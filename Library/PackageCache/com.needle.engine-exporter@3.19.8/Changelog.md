### Upgrade Guide
With version 3.x the Needle Engine Unity integration will install Needle Engine from npm instead of installing a separate Unity package and installing it by filepath. This change is an important step to alig the Unity integration with Blender and all future integrations.

After upgrading please make sure to apply the following changes:

- Open your web project package.json and check that the dependency for `three` does not contain an old `file:` path to a previous installation. It may be necessary to change the value from `"file:/path/"` to `""` (empty string) so that the Unity integration can fill in the correct version. You may also remove the explicit dependency to `three` completely if you are not using e.g. react-three-fiber.

- Open the `vite.config.js` and make sure to remove the custom `alias` configuration for `@needle-tools/engine` and `three`

- If you have been using the Unity `ImageReference` class to export images to external files you should change your runtime code to use the new typescript `ImageReference` class as well (using `@serializable(ImageReference)`)

- The `build:dev` script not contain an extra `tsc` compile call

### â­ Highlights 
#### **Needle Engine is now installed from NPM**  
Needle Engine in Unity is now also installed from NPM. This is an important step to align Unity, Blender and all future integrations. It will also make it easier to publish projects on platforms like Netlify without having to modify the web project. Please see the changelog for the Upgrade Guide.

#### **WebXR ImageTracking**  
Add the `WebXRImageTracking` component to your scene and assign images to be tracked. Currently requires the `webxr-incubations` chrome flag to be enabled.

#### **Screensharing**
Reliability when making new connections or joining a room with an active screensharing session has been improved.

### Exporter
- Add: automatically update npm dependencies for certain packages (e.g. `@needle-tools/engine`) when a normal Semversion is being used
- Add: initial experimental component import support allowing to import glTF files from Blender into Unity with their components intact (similarly glTF files that have been exported in other Unity projects can now be imported including their components) 
  âª **NOTE**: this feature is experimental and not yet production ready. It needs further testing and import does not yet work for all types (known issues where import does not yet work include ParticleSystems and AnimatorControllers where states have missing animation clips)
- Change: bump UnityGLTF dependency to `2.0.0-exp` for import plugin API
- Change: build pipeline tools are now run from an internal package, this removes the need to have a web project setup to export and compress glTF files (e.g. during CI or when using the context menu item on an model or prefab asset)
- Change: remove dependency to extra Unity package and local engine installation.
- Change: paths to external files are not relative to the exported glb (previously they did contain the full path relative to the project root) - this allowed modifications to `needle.config.json` assetsDirectory to work when the folder structure for the deployed version is different to the development structure. NOTE: if you've been exporting external images using `ImageReference` you can now use the new `ImageReference` runtime type to easily resolve them
- Change: Compressed glTF export is now possible without web project
- Change: Full Export now does not restart the server but deletes both Needle Engine as well as vite caches
- Fix: Projects using `needle.config.json` to modify the assets directory are now being built correctly

### Engine
- Add: `ImageReference` type, use to export textures to external files and load them as `img`, `texture` or to get the binary data for e.g. image tracking

- Change: license check is now baked
- Change: Rename "EngineElement" to NeedleEngineHTMLElement
- Change: disable "Enable Keys" on OrbitControls by default as it conflicts with so many things
- Fix: ParticleSystem circle shape
- Fix: balloon messages are now truncated to 300 characters
- Fix: Screensharing connection setup and start of video playback
- Fix: Screensharing muting now local audio
- Fix: AudioSource does not play again when it did finish and the user switches tabs
- Fix: ParticleSystem prewarm
- Fix: ParticleSystem minMax size, it's currently not supported and should thus not affect rendering

## [2.65.0-pre.1] - 2023-03-10
### Exporter
- Fix: issue where `<needle-engine>` element was not yet in the DOM when queried by exporter codegen which caused the paths to not be assigned and the engine to not load

### Engine
- Fix: issue where `<needle-engine>` element was not yet in the DOM when queried by exporter codegen which caused the paths to not be assigned and the engine to not load

## [2.65.0-pre] - 2023-03-09
### Exporter
- Add: Updater to fix wrong import paths due to change in engine package structure (`@needle-tools/engine/src/...`)
- Change: codegen for loading the exported glbs in main scene is now simplified, removing previous and legacy code completely. It now just collects all exported files in an array and sets that as the `src` attribute on the `<needle-engine>` web component. 
- Change: project settings should not show warning for Engine package not being installed when the current scene is not a web project
- Change: engine package should only be automatically installed on update when the current scene is a web project
- Change: type imports now generate without an extension to fix distributed `lib` imports
- Fix: error where unresolved package.json variable did cause IllegalChar exception
- Fix: improved npmdef error handling caused by the hidden package being missing which might happen if a user copies the npmdef to another Unity project but does not copy the hidden package folder (ending with ~). Such cases are now also properly displayed in the ExportInfo component
- Fix: BugReporter should not print error message about toktx not being installed when collecting project information

### Engine
- Add: runtime checks for recursive loading to prevent it from breaking
- Change: internal duplicate active state on `Object3D` has been removed, instead `visible` is used. This was previously a workaround for the `Renderer` setting the visible state when being enabled or disabled but this has been changed in a previous version and it now only sets a flag in the object's Layers instead (which allows for a single object in the hierarchy to not being rendered by setting `Renderer.enabled = false` while objects in the child hierarchy stay visible) 
- Change: `<needle-engine>` src attribute can now also take an array of glbs to load. This simplifies codegen done by exporters and also prevents errors due to bundler optimizations as well as being easier to understand. Runtime changes of the `src` attribute (especially when using arrays of files) have not been tested for this release. Networking for `src` changes has been removed in this release. 
- Change: move engine into src subfolder. All paths to explicit script files are now `@needle-tools/engine/src/...`
- Change: poster screenshot will be taken after 200ms now
- Change: canvas default set to false for castShadow and receiveShadow
- Change: Remote skybox should not set `scene.background` when in XR with pass through device (e.g. when using Quest Pro AR or AR on mobile)
- Fix: issue where ColorAdjustments Volume effect was applied with `active` set to false
- Fix: `Light` not being enabled again after disabling the component once

## [2.64.0-pre] - 2023-03-07
### Exporter
- Add: dependency to `csharp to typescript` package. 
  > This allows to quickly create typescript skeleton or stub components from existing csharp code
  > Created components try to import used types if known, create fields with `@serializable` decorations and methods (the method body needs to be implemented manually)
  > Use the context menu item on csharp script assets or on components in the scene
- Add: When your package.json contains a script named `install` the exporter will invoke this script instead of directly running `npm install`. This allows running projects that e.g. require `yarn install`
- Add: Export audio volume for timeline clip (Timeline audio track settings are not yet supported)
- Fix: Clean install when using project paths starting with `Packages/` or `Assets/`
- Fix: Issue where the `enabled` property of some component types was not exported anymore (e.g. colliders)
- Fix: Issue with license import when using vite 2 caused by BOM

### Engine
- Add: `PlayableDirector` now correctly applies timescale
- Add: `PlayableDirector.speed` property allowing to play the timeline at different speeds or even reverse (reversed audio playback is not supported at the moment)
- Add: `Physics.enabled` property for disabling physics updates. This also prevents any collider shapes to be created
- Add: `this.gameObject.transform` property to ease getting started for devs coming from Unity. This property is merely a forward to `this.gameObject` and shouldnt really be used. The property description contains information and a [link to the docs](https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/docs/transform) with further information.
- Fix: instanced materials using progressive loading are now correctly updated
- Fix: Timeline animation tracks now disable the `Animator`. This fixes cases where two animations were played at the same time. When the PlayableDirector is paused or stopped the animator state is reset

- Fix: Timeline audio not stopping correctly at end of timeline when set to hold
- Change: improve instancing updates, instanced objects now auto update detect matrix changes. This includes improvements of instancing when used with `Animation` components
- Change: set particle system layers to `IgnoreRaycast` to not receive wrong click events on batched particle meshes
- Change: Timeline audio is now loaded on evaluation. Only clips in a range of 1 second to the current time are loading. To manually trigger preload of audio you can invoke `loadAudio` with a time range on audio tracks of a timeline

## [2.63.3-pre] - 2023-03-03
### Exporter
- Change: ExportInfo should install should not show too much information when ALT is pressed
